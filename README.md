Nail-Melanoma-350
We have collected the few images from Dow International Medical College, Karachi, Pakistan, called Nai-Melonamm-350. I would like to thank Dr. Sadia and Dr. Kanwal Memon from JPMS who also helped me to classify the pictures that were extracted from the Internet and books on dermatology about Nail Melanoma. There are 350 images in the original dataset that were used as 70% of the training datasets and 30% of the testing datasets. We augmented the dataset into rotation, width, height, shear, zoom and horizontal to improve the classification tasks.
